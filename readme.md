Symmetry Tile Demo Gallery
=====================

This repository holds a gallery of demo images generated with the Symmetry Tile plug-in for GIMP.

The gallery can be viewed [here](http://elfnor.github.io/symmetrytilegallery). 

__Symmetry Tile__ is a plugin for [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), a wonderful image manipulation program.

The Symmetry Tile plugin (avaliable [here](https://www.github.com/elfnor/symmetrytile)) takes the user's selection ("cell") from an image and produces a new image according to one of the [17 plane symmetry groups ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_groups). These are also known as wallpaper groups or plane crystallographic groups. 

Basically it rotates and or flips copies of the cell, combines them to form a tile and then copies that tile to fill a new image.

More information on the plug-in can be found [here](http://elfnor.github.io/lookthinkmake/tag/symmetrytile.html)
